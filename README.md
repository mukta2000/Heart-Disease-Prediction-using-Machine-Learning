# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

We will be exploring 7-classification algorithms and do a performance analysis to effectively predict if the patient suffers from heart disease. The models are as follows- Support Vector Machine (SVM), Kernel SVM, K-nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classification, Decision Tree Classification, Na√Øve Bayes.
After performing the training and testing the datasets with the above algorithms we will receive a performance analysis of the models, thus we can find the most accurate model that will provide better results in predicting the heart disease effectively and efficiently.
